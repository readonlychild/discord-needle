# Fork Commands

## `/tags`

### tags view

Display current thread tags.

### tags clear

Remove all tags from current thread.

### tags add

Add tags to current thread, appends to existing tags.

### tags replace

Replace tags for current thread.

### tags status 

Assign a status to the thread.

### tags stats-top

List top 25 tags (defaults to last 30 days).

## `/archive`

### s3Handler.js

### fsHandler.js

### Notes

- For development (`npm run dev`), folder `/src/handlers/archive/` must be copied over to `/dist/handlers/`.  This because archive handlers are loaded dynamically so the build process does not include the files.

## `/card`

Builds a `card` for the user and includes badges depending on user server roles.



# Self-hosting

This step-by-step guide assumes you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version `16.9.0` or higher installed and that you have a Discord Bot user set up at [Discord's developer page](https://discord.com/developers/applications) that has been invited to your server with the scopes `applications.commands` and `bot`.

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and insert your bot's Discord API token and Application ID.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run deploy`. This will make the slash commands show up in the servers the bot are in, but **it can take up to _ONE HOUR_ before they show up**.
5. Make sure the bot has the required permissions in Discord:
    - [x] View channels
    - [x] Send messages
    - [x] Send messages in threads
    - [x] Create public threads
    - [x] Read message history
6. Run `npm start`
7. Deploy! :tada:
