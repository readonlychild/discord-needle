# Fork Commands

## `/tags`

### tags view

### tags clear

Remove all tags from current thread.

### tags add

### Notes

- For development (`npm run dev`), folder `/src/handlers/archive/` must be copied over to `/dist/handlers/`.  This because archive handlers are loaded dynamically so the build process does not include the files.
