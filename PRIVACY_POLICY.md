# Privacy policy

Needle has never and will never collect any personal data. This includes message content, names, IP-adresses, time stamps, member information, etc.

## What we collect

We do not collect any data automatically. The only data we collect is user-provided guild configuration data for Needle. When this is provided (by invoking configuration commands), we may collect:

-   Guild IDs
-   Channel IDs
-   Custom responses
-   Which features are enabled or disabled

## Data retention

The data is deleted from the main disk when one of the following occurs:

-   Needle is removed from the guild
-   A user successfully invokes the `/configure default` command
-   A user indicates to us by other means that they want their data deleted

The data may persist in full-disk copies made for backup-purposes for up to 7 days after it was originally deleted.

## Where information is processed

Needle is hosted on a data center in Helsinki, Finland by [Hetzner Online GmbH](https://www.hetzner.com/legal/privacy-policy). The bot communicates with [Discord](https://discord.com/privacy)'s API to interact with users.

## Changes to this privacy policy

We reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time, with at least 24 hours prior notice in the [Discord support server](https://needle.gg/chat). Your continued use of Needle after the changes have been applied indicates that you agree with the revised privacy policy.

## Contact

Feel free to contact us at [privacy@needle.gg](mailto:privacy@needle.gg) if you have any questions about this privacy policy.
